# ArtGallery — Assignment 1 Starter

This repository contains **9 pages** built with **HTML/CSS and Bootstrap 5**:

- `index.html` → Gallery Home Page
- `art-list.html` → Art Display Page (cards list)
- `login.html` → Login Page (static form)
- `signup.html` → SignUp Page (static form)
- `starry-night.html`, `mona-lisa.html`, `persistence-of-memory.html`, `girl-with-pearl-earring.html`, `the-scream.html` → 5 individual artwork pages

### Notes
- No JavaScript validation or backend required.
- Images are **hotlinked** from Wikimedia (no need to upload image files).
- Animations are implemented via CSS (`styles.css`) and a tiny script (`script.js`).

## How to submit

### 1) Create GitHub repo
- Create a new repo called **ArtGallery** (or any name).
